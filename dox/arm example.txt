Logo Design Guide

Exhibit A

LOGO

The marks must appear exactly as shown in this Logo Design Guide; the elements, proportions and relationships must not change. The marks are available in slat repro form and in cps for Macintosh or WMF for PC platforms. These formats ensure the highest possible reproduction quality. However, should you need another format for a specific project, please contact your local ARM office for advice.

When produced in colour, the mark should he printed in Pantone 314 blue. Process colour reproduction may not match Pantone-identified solid colour standards. When specifying the colour of the mark with process inks, the correct mix is:

 
				

cyan
	   	  	100 	  

Magenta
	   	  	0 	  

Yellow
	   	  	8.5 	  

Black
	   	  	34 	  

 
• 	  	

Do not alter or deform the shape of the marks.

 
• 	  	

Do not replace the logotype with a different typeface or attempt to mimic the logotype typeface.

 
• 	  	

Do not place competing visual elements (including but not limited to other Trademarks) close to the marks.

 
• 	  	

Do not set type near to the marks that could be construed as a corporate slogan or motto
