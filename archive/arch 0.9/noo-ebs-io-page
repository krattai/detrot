### Welcome to the noo ebs Github landing page.

This project has begun 2014/08/14.

The project wiki page is located here:

This is the preliminary discussion and proof of concept phase. It is hoped that the framework and associated software necessary for such a system will be developed and refined as an ongoing process.

### NOO - EBS stands for Nine One One (911) - Emergency Broadcast System

In a world that seems constantly, and even more so than in past times, under some form of threat to human life, and the technologies that exist to prevent harm to human life, we still see countless people who are injured, put at (what should seem like unnecessary) risk, and even killed due to natural and man made disasters.

From tsunamis, to hurricanes, to earth quakes, to wars and civil unrest and conflict, to accidents (preventable or otherwise), we have the ability to help ensure everyone has the ability to be notified of impending threat or to warn or communicate impending threat or emergency.

Even in the mid 2000's the entire south east region of the province of Manitoba was without 911 services, due to a severed phone trunk, which even affected cell and internet service, and some television service in certain communities. While that problem was rectified within a few days, the risk to life and limb for that population was great.

The goal of this project is to develop a system which will create a simple, digital framework which can create a global infrastructure, that would allow for everyone to receive threat notifications in a timely manner (technically, the speed of digital technologys; the speed of light), and also allow those with technologies that utilize this framework, to communicate a threat, or request help.

This project will be under an Open Source License or potentially Public Domain, once it is determined the best and most beneficial means of managing this framework, while still allowing it to ultimately be of unrestricted value to all, throughout the world, and beyond.
