1. Preparation
   It's suggested to install the ubuntu-8.10-alternate-i386.iso CD
image
in case of new start.
   To create a xorg.conf to meet user's environment, there are few
procedures to generate the xorg.conf template listed as below before
entering X-Windows.
   1.1 After Intrepid installed in text mode by default, reboot and
hit
<ESC> right before OS boots. This brings up the Grub Menu for boot
option.
   1.2 From the available modes, select the one ended with "(recovery
mode)" then enter to boot.
   1.3 Login as root at prompt in text mode.
   1.4 Produce the X configuration file according to your own system 
       X -configure
       This generates a file named xorg.conf.new under $HOME folder of
the user.  
   1.5 Copy the new xorg.conf to and backup the original one
       cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.viabak
       cp $HOME/xorg.conf.new /etc/X11/xorg.conf
